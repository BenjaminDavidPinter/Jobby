# Jobby - A Job Runner

Do you often find yourself running some random SQL Script, or Powershell Command regularly to maintain some process? Are your fingers the lynchpin which holds together a critical moment in your business?

Jobby solves a simple problem; Do something every so often for me. Sometimes that might be sending an email. Perhaps running a folder clean up script. Maybe running a statistical query on your DB. 

Why setup a Windows Scheduled Task, SQL Job, and whatever else is out there when you could do it in one program?
